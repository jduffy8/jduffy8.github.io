## Team History
Founded by Lamar Hunt, the team originated in the AFL before the merger of the two football leagues. The team began as the Dallas Texans before relocating to Kansas City in 1963. Shortly after relocation, Lamar Hunt got the idea to challenge the NFL champion Green Bay Packers to play his AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs in a game of epic proportions. After seeing his son play with a bouncy Super Ball, Hunt decided to name the game the Super Bowl. The Chiefs lost the game but gained the respect of NFL fans across the country. 4 years later, the two leagues merged and the modern National Football League was born, with two conferences, the NFC and the AFC.

## Recent Successes.
In the last 5 years, the team has hosted the American Football Championship at their home stadium, Arrowhead. This has been due to being the top seeded opponent in the game. From these 5 games, the team has won 3 to advance to the Super Bowl, winning two. These victories were spurred by **Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Andy Reid**. These victories have launched the team into a new era of success, with the team becoming synonymous with winning.
